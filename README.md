# Arduino-3-D-Printed-Train6-Arduino-NX2206

Software: 
CAD (NX 2206), Arduino, 3D Printing (TAZ Lulzbot)

Goal: 
Create a 3D-printed train that uses Arduino features to move. 

Features: 
(3) 3D-printed compartments, (1) Arduino DC motor, (1) ultrasonic humidifier, (1) microphone sound sensor 

Requirements: 
(3) compartments, passenger seats, conductor seat, working motor, functioning wheels, "release" on cart connections, exterior extrusions that resemble a train

Project Duration:
April 4 - April 30 

Roles and Responsibilities:
Myself - Project lead, dimension planning, Arduino code, NX-2206 assembly
Groupmate 1 - NX-2206, design and create the locomotive compartment 
Groupmate 2 - NX-2206, create the middle compartment and caboose 

Summary: 
Within a group of 3, each member was responsible for completing a certain section of the train project. Our train had to fit the constraints of 200-450 mm length, 50-100 mm width, and 100-150 mm height along with the requirement of 3 compartments with one compartment including passenger seating. 
Over one month, dimension planning for all 3 compartments was created within the first 3 days. An agreement was made to include train whistle sounds and steam-blowing in addition to the requirement of a working DC motor. 
2 weeks in, with the dimensions complete, the design process for all 3 carts was started and finished. The conductor's compartment was hollow and allowed for the DC motor to sit on top of the chassis. The middle compartment allowed room for the Arduino nanoboard to sit in. The last compartment was made for passenger seating with a couple of freedom riders inside. 
3 weeks in, the Arduino code in C++ was completed along with the third compartment. Assembly of the train was completed and submitted by the end of the week and all designs were sent over to be 3D printed.
The last week included the assembly of the completed 3D printed parts with a functioning DC motor, microphone for whistle-blowing, and a humidifier for steam.
